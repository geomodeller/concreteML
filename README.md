## 📌 Project Overview

**concreteML** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on a variety of physical and chemical input variables. This project is conducted as part of the 2025 Summer Undergraduate Research Program at Inha University.

The goal is to explore the relationships between key concrete mix components (e.g., cement, slag, water, coarse/fine aggregate) and the resulting strength, using statistical and machine learning techniques. Through this, we aim to build predictive models that can aid in optimizing mix design for desired performance.

## 🧪 Methodology

The project workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Literature Review**  
   - Review academic papers on concrete strength prediction and machine learning applications in materials science.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize and analyze the distribution and range of variables.
   - Understand data patterns, outliers, and relationships.

3. **Correlation Analysis & Feature Engineering**  
   - Investigate correlation between features and compressive strength.
   - Engineer features to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

4. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - Develop and compare various regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Decision Tree (DT)
     - Random Forest (RF)
     - XGBoost

5. **Performance Evaluation**  
   - Use metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R² to compare model performance.
